## YouTube will be unavailable until further notice

**Summary:**

On June 27, 2023, YouTube revoked CyTube's API access, causing all requests to
add YouTube videos to fail.  The reviewer claims that CyTube is in violation of
the Terms of Service:

> Violations that required immediate resolution:
> Policy #: III.I.1(YouTube clone)
> Violation: API Clients must not mimic or replicate YouTube's core user
> experiences by recreating features or process flows unless they add
> significant independent value or functionality that improves users
> interactions with YouTube.

I disagree with this assessment, especially given that I previously went through
a review in 2020 with the same information given and the reviewer concluded the
website was in "full compliance".  However, the rejection email offers no
specific feedback on why they believe CyTube is not compliant, no guidance on
what to change in order to be considered compliant (only a vague collection of
screenshots of normal usage of the website with no written notes), and no
opportunity to appeal or reconsider the decision other than to completely
resubmit the application and go through the months-long review process again.

~~Given that YouTube has provided me with no clear path forward, I cannot give an
ETA on whether or when CyTube will be able to support YouTube again.~~

As of July 2023, I have submitted an appeal form to request that YouTube review
my application again, and I have been going back and forth with the reviewer to
answer some of their questions.  I still do not have an ETA for when it will
be working again, nor do I have 100% confidence that it will be approved.
